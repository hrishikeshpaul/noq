     <p>It is NoQ's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website.
       This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="http://noq-client.herokuapp.com">noq-client.herokuapp.com</a>
       (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "noq-client.herokuapp.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting
       personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy
       ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and
       under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to
       information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.
     </p>
     <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general rules
       and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be
       required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>

     <h5>Website Visitors</h5>
     <p>Like most website operators, NoQ collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
       and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date
       and time of each visitor request. NoQ's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better
       understand how NoQ's visitors use its website. From time to time, NoQ may release non-personally-identifying
       information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
     <p>NoQ also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged
       in users and for users leaving comments on http://noq-client.herokuapp.com blog posts. NoQ only discloses logged
       in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
       information as described below.</p>

     <h5>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h5>
     <p>Certain visitors to NoQ's websites choose to interact with NoQ in ways that require NoQ to gather
       personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that NoQ gathers depends on the nature of
       the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at http://noq-client.herokuapp.com to provide
       a username and email address.</p>

     <h5>Security</h5>
     <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over
       the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means
       to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

     <h5>Advertisements</h5>
     <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These
       cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile
       information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things,
       deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the
       use of cookies by NoQ and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

     <h5>Links To External Sites</h5>
     <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link,
       you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms and
       conditions of every site you visit.</p>
     <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third
       party sites, products or services.</p>

     <h5>Aggregated Statistics</h5>
     <p>NoQ may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. NoQ may display this information
       publicly or provide it to others. However, NoQ does not disclose your personally-identifying information.</p>

     <h5>Cookies</h5>
     <p>To enrich and perfect your online experience, NoQ uses "Cookies", similar technologies and services provided by
       others to display personalized content, appropriate advertising and store your preferences on your computer.</p>
     <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser
       provides to the website each time the visitor returns. NoQ uses cookies to help NoQ identify and track visitors,
       their usage of http://noq-client.herokuapp.com, and their website access preferences. NoQ visitors who do not wish
       to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using NoQ's websites,
       with the drawback that certain features of NoQ's websites may not function properly without the aid of
       cookies.</p>
     <p>By continuing to navigate our website without changing your cookie settings, you hereby acknowledge and agree to
       NoQ's use of cookies.</p>

     <h5>Privacy Policy Changes</h5>
     <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, NoQ may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in NoQ's
       sole discretion. NoQ encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your
       continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such
       change.</p>
