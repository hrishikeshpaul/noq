<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

No Q, is a revolutionary tool which allows for both employers and students to skip the hassle seen in modern day career fairs. For the students, we have an intuitive profile builder where you can add things like education, skills, certifications, honors, and experiences. These all culminate into a sleek home page where you will see all the positions in which your skills meet the criteria! If you are curious about the most in-demand skills, you can use our “What-if” feature where you can manually input skills to see the positions which require them. On top of that, we offer a variety of different ways to filter the posted positions; including location, skills, job title, and more. Applying is easier than ever before, as all the student needs to do is click on the position card and click on the green arrow, automatically applying them from the position and remove it from their home page. No Q is not only good for students, but employers as well! A common problem at modern career fairs is the number of unqualified candidates who waste their time when they could be chatting with someone else. With No Q, only the students who meet the positions’ criteria will be able to apply, and from there the recruiter can invite them to talk in more detail at the career fair through our intuitive messaging system. The employer also has an easy to manage list of all applicants, making it very easy to see their most important features, such as experience and the technical skills they possess.d resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
